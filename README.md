### Starting out

If you are seeing my profile for the first time, i recommend going to these projects:

- [Needle Shell](https://github.com/YourUsername/Needle-Shell): A custom shell script project to handle system tasks efficiently.
- [DayreaverToolKit](https://github.com/DayreaverDoesThings/DayreaverToolKit): A toolkit for Windows that automates various tasks.
